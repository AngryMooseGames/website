Get comfy because I have a lot to tell you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'm quite proud of what i've been doing with the UI so far.</div><div><br></div><div>The first thing I started working on was the main menu. I have a pretty basic one right now. You can join a game, create a game, and browse servers. Oh, and there's also a friends list.</div><div><br></div><div>The second thing I worked on was the health HUD. It's pretty basic right now, because there's no way to actually get health.</div><div><br></div><div>One thing I want to add is a console. I've been messing around with the default UE4 one, but I feel like I can make a much better one where you can see in-depth error logs and game info.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, I worked on everything else. Spawnmenu, pause menu, level loading, etc. The base UI right now is really nice and clean, and I feel like I'm gonna have a lot more fun with the UE4 UI!</div><div></div>

                <div></div><div>Importing assets is hard.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I spent around 2 days importing some sounds, weapons, models, and maps from Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source. Sounds were easy but importing and rigging the weapons was hard. I imported datacore and c3a1_d into the game, they're textureless right now as I need to improve the importer a lot. Oh, and I added some weapon animations. They aren't exact to the cs:s anims, but they're pretty close.</div><div class="edit-block" contenteditable="false" blocktype="image" title=""><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/786017730092204062/810294557680992256/weapons.PNG" class="lightbox-thumbnail"></div><div>Above are the weapons I rigged. Don't mind the dev textures.</div><div class="edit-block" contenteditable="false" blocktype="video" title=""><video controls="" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/786017730092204062/810550634058350622/2021-02-14_10-35-21_Trim.mp4"></video></div><div>I messed around with the Half-life 2 sounds, and made a little audio player. I only imported 2, but it actually sounds pretty smooth, which im suprised by. I made it fade out from far away as well, which is cool.</div><div><br></div><h2>Anything else you want to import? Can I import textures?</h2><div class="edit-block" contenteditable="false" blocktype="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/786017730092204062/810553284573003786/Capture.PNG"></div><div>Well, I aim to import an entire map later on, with full textures. Importing models from somewhere else works fine right now, but I want you to be able to import bsp, fbx, obj, and some others fast and without going to anything other than where the file is located.

            </div>



            <div class="content" editname="Contents" using-lightbox>
                <div></div><div class="edit-block" contenteditable="false" blocktype="image" data-image-style="floatr"></div><div></div><div>I want people to be able to upload their creations from the ingame map editor (I call it build mode), and put it on steam workshop, or where ever else they want to. I also want people to be able to create gamemodes in C#. Currently, I have a wip ghost gamemode made in C#. I have it so that making and mounting any workshop content (gamemodes, spawn items, etc) is as easy as possible. You upload your item, it creates a json so the game knows what it is, the addon has folders that contain all the code and UI elements, and it then downloads and adds it to the menu, where you can play it. That's about it. You can only play 'workshop' content in singleplayer, for right now at least. tl;dr: C# gamemodes and addons are coming soonᵀᴹ, I just need to add some stuff and try to actually implement Steam workshop (or mod io, which I'll talk about later).
                    <br>Currently, build mode is pretty simple, you can create a voxel-like map. There's an ability to save/load your creations. I was looking at a Steam Workshop alternative called mod.io. mod.io is basically steam workshop, but implementing it in your game is literally as easy as it gets, and you can upload your creations from the website. mod.io has a few downsides, but I'll look at it all once I get that Steam page.&nbsp;</div><h2>Voxels? Huh?</h2>It's not exactly voxels, you can just spawn cubes into the map, and they have random colors. I recommend making a disco room.<br><h2>A bit more about build mode</h2>I already added the base stuff to build mode. UI, block placement, saving and loading, but I want to do more. I want to add copying, more map tools (prefabs, asset importing, lighting, texture stuff, and so on). This is all within reach, and I hope to get it out by release.</ul><div><br></div></div><div></div>

                <div class="edit-block" contenteditable="false" blocktype="image"></image></div><div>Currently, when you start a new game you create a local listen server, and you have the option to create a multiplayer server. No, I don't plan to add anti-cheat any time soon.</div><div><br></div><div>Servers actually hold up pretty well with a large amount of players, although it sometimes tanks when a player spawns a large amount of stuff.</div><div><ul><div><div>Multiplayer needs some fixes</div></div><li>Spawn items like to be client sided, not server sided. 50% of the time stuff you spawn loads in fine, but sometimes it completely breaks and spawned stuff only shows up for you, even though other players can interact with it</li><li>Servers need chat and a scoreboard. A scoreboard isn't needed, but it would be nice. And chat will be added soon, I already have a chatbox, but right now it only has alerts when players spawn and are killed.</li><li>Currently there's only multiplayer sandbox. I'd like some sort of a collaborative build mode, with some sandbox features.</li></ul><div>Everything else works fine though, although I still like singleplayer more than multiplayer right now.</div></div>
